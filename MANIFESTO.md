# Pomai Manifesto

## The World Needs a New Database Philosophy

For decades, software was built _for the machine_.  
Then, in the pursuit of speed, it was built _for the cloud_.  
Now, in the breathless dash for AI, it's built only for the giants—  
for datacenters, GPUs, modern luxury hardware that most humans will never touch.

**We reject this.**

## PomaiDB: For Everyone, Everywhere

**PomaiDB** is not just a vector database.  
It is a declaration:

> **AI should run on what people already have.**

- Old laptops.
- Used desktops found in a lab or school.
- IoT boxes gathering dust.
- Air-gapped workstations.  
- Modest VMs in faraway regions.

**We build for these places.**

## Our Belief

- **The Power of Enough:**  
  You do not need an NVIDIA A100 to explore intelligence.  
  You just need software willing to _try_.

- **Adapt, Don't Crash:**  
  When memory or CPU runs thin, PomaiDB does not break.  
  It adapts, it scales back, it endures.

- **Clarity Over Jargon:**  
  We value algorithms for what they _trade_, not just what they promise.  
  A good database is not the sum of published graphs—it is a loyal engine under duress.

## Principles

**1. Respect the Machine**  
PomaiDB treats the OS as a teammate, not a bug—using mmap, trusting the page cache, 
leaning on atomic filesystem semantics.

**2. Protect the User**  
No crash, no silent corruption, no “just add more RAM.” PomaiDB is wrung through
edge cases and adversarial loads. When the system is stressed, PomaiDB _whispers, not shouts_.

**3. Graceful Degradation**  
Every computation costs. PomaiDB accounts for every operation, not just for performance,
but for fairness—so that under pressure, everyone gets something, and no one ruins it for others.

**4. Local First, Cloud Optional**  
Your data, your device. PomaiDB is to run on the edge _by birth_, not by a subset of its features.

**5. Open Source, Open World**  
AI infrastructure does not belong to monopolies.  
We release PomaiDB to push back on the notion that _intelligence must be centralized_.

## What PomaiDB Defies

- That high performance must be exclusive.  
- That reliability requires abundance.  
- That fallback is a sign of weakness.  
- That databases are “just engineering”, not acts of care.

---

## An Invitation

**To the students in emerging markets, to the engineers with little RAM,  
to the educators, hackers, curious souls:**  
PomaiDB is for _your_ machine.

If you believe
- Software should _bend_ to the real world,
- Systems should _fail gracefully_,
- AI should _not_ be reserved for the richest nodes,

then **this project is yours**.

---

## A Promise

PomaiDB will fight for your CPU, your RAM,  
your uptime, your safety,  
and—most of all—your right to _build_ with what you have.

> **AI is not a luxury.  
> AI is potential, everywhere.**
